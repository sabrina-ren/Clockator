Clockator    <img src = http://imgur.com/cBynclA.png>
=========
A handy, social clock that shares your location (and as expected, the time). 
- Relevant, noninvasive information is shared, while your geographical location is kept private
- Add and name places you want to share, such as home or a cafe
- When youâ€™re at a saved place, your location status is updated to the place name
- See if your roommates are home or if your friend can pick up a coffee for you, and abolish those daily where-are-you   texts
